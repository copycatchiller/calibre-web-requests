There's a few ways you can do this:

#### Send to E-Reader Button
This is the most convenient way since you can do it in one click. You only have to set it up once.
**Setup**
1. Go to amazon.com/myk
2. Click into your kindle device
3. Go to preferences â†’ Send-to-kindle E-mail settings
	1. First, go to the bottom and add *copycatchiller@outlook.com* to your approved e-mail list (this is the address that will send the file to your kindle)
	2. Now, scroll back up to your device list and copy the e-mail address for your kindle. This will look something like username_32@kindle.com.
4. Go to calibre.copycatchiller.com and log into your account.
5. Go to your account settings and paste your @kindle.com address into the "Send to E-reader E-mail address"
6. Scroll down and hit save.
**Sending books**
1. Go to any book and click the paper airplane icon (Send to e-reader).
3. wait for the book to get to your kindle (make sure you're connected to wifi :)
